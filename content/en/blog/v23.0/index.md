This release has been tracked through the [v23.0
project](https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor/projects/27).

### vDPA Support

A vDPA device has a datapath that complies with the virtio specification but
with a vendor specific control path. The addition of `--vdpa` and the REST API
equivalent allows the use of these devices with Cloud Hypervisor.

### Updated OS Support list

The list of officially supported and tested OS versions has been updated to
include Ubuntu "jammy" 22.04 and EOLed versions removed.

### `AArch64` Memory Map Improvements

The memory map when running on `AArch64` has been improved for the handling of
the UEFI region which means that the booted guest OS now has full access to its
allocated RAM. (#3938)

### `AMX` Support

Under a compile time gate of `amx` it is possible compile in support for the
`AMX` instruction set extension for guest use. This also requires runtime
enabling with `--cpu features=amx`.

### Notable Bug Fixes

* Generate error when incorrect HTTP method used for some API endpoints (#3887)
* CMOS based reset is now available to support rebooting on "jammy" (#3914)
* ACPI tables are not produced for memory hotplug when running with
  `virtio-mem` (#3883)
* `virtio-iommu` backed PCI segments are now comprehensively placed behind the
  vIOMMU (#3870)
* Seccomp rules have been extended for `virtio-fs` to support direct access
  (#3848)

### Deprecations

Deprecated features will be removed in a subsequent release and users should
plan to use alternatives

* The `mergeable` option from the `virtio-pmem` support has been deprecated
  (#3968)
* The `dax` option from the `virtio-fs` support has been deprecated (#3889)
